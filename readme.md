# GridNavigator (Unreal 5.3 Plugin)

This project offers a straightforward replacement for the built-in navmesh system in Unreal Engine. It enables movement along a configurable grid, similar to CRPGs like the original Fallout games and UnderRail. This repository is a work-in-progress, and will have setup instructions soon.
